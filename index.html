	<h2>Basketball 🏀</h2>
    <p>
	I love basketball, it's my passion since I was a child. I started this sport when I was 8 and played in a club for 12 years until I was 20. Since then I still play regularly in the street with my friends or people I meet on the basketball courts.
    Below is a photo of me during a match with my brother.

	<h2>Cooking 👨‍🍳</h2>
    <p>
	I enjoy cooking! I'm not a great chef or even a good cooker, but I master my classics. And as a good recipe is worth all the talk, here is the recipe for my favorite dish: carbonara pasta!
    </p>
    <ol>
    	<li>
    		Cook the pasta in a large volume of salted boiling water.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		Slice the onions and brown them in the pan. As soon as they are golden brown, add the bacon.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		Prepare the "crème fraiche", eggs, salt and pepper in a salad bowl and mix.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		Remove the bacon from the heat as soon as they are golden and add them to the cream.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		Once the pasta is cooked al dente, drain it and add the cream. Return to the heat if the dish has cooled.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		Serve and enjoy your meal!
            You can also decorate your dish with mushrooms.
    	</li>
    </ol>

	<h2>Manual and outdoor activities 🎨 🏝</h2>
    <p>
	I like to practice manual activities and more generally outdoor activities. I like sport, walks and travel. In October 2020 I went for a week to Greece, Athens and the Greek Islands. So when I got home I painted a painting of Santorini, a famous Greek island. Enjoy the masterpiece just below.
